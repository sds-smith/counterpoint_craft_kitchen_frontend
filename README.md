# Counterpoint Craft Kitchen

As with some of my other personal portfolio work, this project serves as a playground where I can explore and experiment with new (well, new-to-me) technologies.

Still very much in its infancy stage, this eCommerce React application is one part of a loosely-coupled software system.

## System integrations:
  * **Frontend**: React
  * **Backend**: Node/Express
  * **API/ Data management layer**: Ruby on Rails

The menu data is fetched by the Express server from the API, processed and returned to the Frontend. Payment processing via PayPal API is also handled by the backend. A future release will also include Doordash for delivery options.

## Current frontend tech stack includes:
  * React
  * React-router-dom
  * Material-UI
  * Zustand state management
  * PayPal SDK for rendering payment buttons
